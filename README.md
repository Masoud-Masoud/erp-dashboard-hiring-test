# ERP Web Dashboard — Phase 1 (90 min)

## Goal
Build a small internal ERP-style web dashboard that communicates with a REST API.
This simulates a “front-end on top of an existing front-end” used for data entry.

## Timebox
90 minutes (live during interview).

## What we evaluate
- REST API integration + auth
- Clean and practical UI for data entry
- Correct handling of business rules
- Debugging skills (network/errors)
- Code clarity and structure

---

## Setup
Run the API and the UI in two terminals.

### Terminal 1 (API)
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
